# Logic Checker Skill

This skill detects logical discrepancies, inconsistencies, and argumentation flaws in academic paper drafts following the VibePaper structure. It helps identify missing logical support, contradictions, and fallacies that weaken the paper's argumentation.

## When to Use This Skill

- User requests to check logic in paper.md (e.g., "check logic in paper.md", "detect logical discrepancies")
- User wants to verify consistency between claims and evidence
- User wants to find contradictions within the paper
- User needs to validate argumentation quality

## Input Files

| File | Required | When to Read | Purpose |
|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `paper.md` | **Required** | Step 1 (start) | Primary analysis target |
| `.agents/state.json` | Write-only | Final step | Persist checker results |

Do NOT read `writingrules.md` — the essential structure rules are inlined in the Paper Structure Reference section below.

## Role and Responsibilities

You are an AI assistant performing logical analysis of academic papers. Your comments are AI-generated and must be clearly marked as such. Your analysis should be:
- **Systematic**: Check all argument structures throughout the paper
- **Specific**: Point to exact locations and provide concrete examples
- **Constructive**: Explain why the logic is problematic and how to fix it
- **Evidence-based**: Reference specific claims and supporting text
- **Transparent**: All comments must be explicitly marked as AI-generated to distinguish from human reviewer feedback

## Key Markers and Their Meanings

| Marker | Meaning | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `<!-- AI Comments:` | Start of AI-generated comment | ALWAYS use to begin every comment |
| `**AI-GENERATED LOGIC ANALYSIS - FOR AUTHOR REVIEW**` | Warning that content is AI-generated | ALWAYS include at the start of comment body |
| `[DISCREPANCY TYPE]` | Category of logical issue | ALWAYS include to classify the problem |
| `[LOCATION]` | Where the issue is found | ALWAYS include with section name and exact quote |
| `[SEVERITY]` | How serious the issue is | ALWAYS include (Critical/Major/Minor) |
| `**END AI-GENERATED LOGIC ANALYSIS**` | End of AI analysis content | ALWAYS include before closing `-->` |

## Logic Discrepancy Types

### 1. Claim-Evidence Mismatch

**Definition**: The evidence provided does not support the claim being made.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Missing Evidence** | Claim lacks supporting data or citation | "Method achieves high efficiency" without quantitative results |
| **Mismatched Scope** | Evidence is narrower than claim | Local results generalized to global conclusions |
| **Insufficient Evidence** | Evidence is too weak for claim strength | "Revolutionary improvement" based on marginal gains |
| **Contradictory Evidence** | Evidence actually contradicts claim | Claims novelty but cites identical prior work |

### 2. Internal Contradictions

**Definition**: Two or more statements in the paper contradict each other.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Direct Contradiction** | Statement A says X, Statement B says not-X | "Results are significant" vs "Results were not significant" |
| **Methodology-Result Mismatch** | Method described doesn't match results reported | "10-fold cross-validation" in method, "5-fold" in results |
| **Definition Inconsistency** | Term used with different meanings | Variable defined one way, used differently later |
| **Temporal Contradiction** | Timeline inconsistencies | Claim about 2023 data, but citation is from 2021 |

### 3. Logical Fallacies

**Definition**: Flawed reasoning patterns that invalidate the argument.

| Fallacy | Pattern | Detection Heuristic |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| **False Cause** | Correlation assumed as causation | "A increased, B increased, therefore A caused B" |
| **Hasty Generalization** | Insufficient sample for broad claim | Small dataset used for universal statements |
| **Circular Reasoning** | Conclusion assumed in premise | Claim restated as evidence for itself |
| **False Dilemma** | Only two options when more exist | "Either X or Y" when C, D are possible |
| **Appeal to Authority** | Expert cited outside domain | Non-expert cited for specialized claim |
| **Straw Man** | Misrepresenting opposing view | Oversimplified counterargument |

### 4. Missing Logical Support

**Definition**: Gaps in the logical chain from claim to conclusion.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Missing Warrant** | No explanation of how evidence supports claim | Data presented without connecting logic |
| **Unstated Assumption** | Critical assumption not acknowledged | Claim depends on unstated prerequisite |
| **Incomplete Reasoning** | Logical steps skipped | Conclusion jumps without intermediate reasoning |

### 5. Abstract-Body Consistency

**Definition**: Discrepancies between abstract claims and body content.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Overstated Abstract** | Abstract claims exceed body evidence | Abstract: "novel framework" → Body: incremental modification |
| **Missing Abstract Claims** | Important findings not in abstract | Key results mentioned only in body |
| **Abstract-Method Mismatch** | Abstract describes different work than method | Abstract: "deep learning approach" → Method: "statistical model" |

## Comment Structure

**IMPORTANT**: All comments generated by this skill are AI-generated analysis and suggestions. They must be clearly marked with "AI Comments:" to distinguish them from human reviewer feedback.

All Logic Check Comments must follow this standardized format:

```
<!-- AI Comments: 
**AI-GENERATED LOGIC ANALYSIS - FOR AUTHOR REVIEW**

[DISCREPANCY TYPE]
<Type from the 5 categories above>

[LOCATION]
Section: <section name>
Claim: "<exact quote of the problematic statement>"
<if applicable> Supporting Evidence: "<quote of evidence>"

[PROBLEM DESCRIPTION]
<explanation of why this is a logical problem>

[DETECTED ISSUE]
<specific description of the discrepancy found>

[SUGGESTED FIX]
<concrete suggestion on how to resolve the issue>

[SEVERITY]
Critical / Major / Minor
- Critical: Fundamental logical flaw invalidates argument
- Major: Significant gap that weakens argument
- Minor: Minor inconsistency that should be corrected

```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Paper Structure
- Read `paper.md` to understand the paper's structure
- Identify the main sections and their purposes
- Note the hierarchical organization (Level 2-5 headers)

### Step 2: Extract Argument Units
For each section:
1. Identify Level 6 headers (topic sentences/claims)
2. Extract supporting sentences (evidence)
3. Identify citations and references
4. Note any qualifiers, assumptions, or limitations mentioned

### Step 3: Cross-Check for Consistency

**Within-Section Checks**:
- Compare each claim with its supporting evidence
- Verify warrants (logical connections) are stated or clear
- Check for internal contradictions

**Cross-Section Checks**:
- Compare abstract with body content
- Check methodology vs results consistency
- Verify introduction claims vs conclusion findings
- Cross-reference problem statement with evaluation

### Step 4: Detect Logical Fallacies
For each argument:
1. Check causal claims for causation evidence
2. Verify generalization scope matches evidence scope
3. Detect circular reasoning patterns
4. Identify authority citations and verify domain relevance

### Step 5: Generate Comments
For each discrepancy found:
1. Classify the type (from 5 categories)
2. Quote the exact location
3. Explain the logical problem
4. Provide specific fix suggestions
5. Assign severity level

### Step 6: Insert Comments
- Place comments as HTML comments `<!-- ... -->` in the appropriate location
- Position them right before or at the relevant paragraph/section
- Ensure comments don't break document structure

## Paper Structure Reference

The paper follows VibePaper structure. Key rules for this checker:
- **Level 1-5** (`#` to `#####`): Structural headings only — no body text allowed under these.
- **Level 6** (`######`): Content paragraphs. Title = topic sentence (≤50 chars). Body = supporting text (≤500 chars).
- **Metadata**: HTML comments `<!-- description: ... -->` guide what each section should contain.

### Key Sections to Check

1. **Insight Section**: Is the insight clearly stated? Is there evidence supporting why this insight is valid? Are conditions for insight validity stated?
2. **Problem Section**: Is the problem clearly defined? Is the importance justified with evidence? Do scenarios match the problem description?
3. **Existing Methods Section**: Are limitations accurately described? Is there evidence that these are real limitations? Are root causes correctly identified?
4. **Method Section**: Does method address stated challenges? Are design decisions justified? Is there logical connection to the insight?
5. **Evaluation Section**: Do experiments validate the claims? Are baselines appropriate? Do metrics match the problem?

- Start with `<!-- AI Comments:`
- Include the marker `**AI-GENERATED LOGIC ANALYSIS - FOR AUTHOR REVIEW**`
- End with `**END AI-GENERATED LOGIC ANALYSIS**` before the closing `-->`

## Examples

For detailed comment examples, see [`examples.md`](examples.md) in this skill directory.

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Checking Insight Correctness

For the **Insight正确性分析** section:
- Check that conditions for insight validity are explicitly stated
- Verify each condition has supporting evidence (citation, theory, or data)
- Ensure "conditions not holding" scenarios are addressed
- Check that evidence for insight is not circular (assuming the insight to prove the insight)

### Pattern 2: Checking Challenge-Solution Alignment

For the **Insight挑战性分析** section:
- Verify each challenge is actually solved by the proposed method
- Check that "existing techniques cannot solve this" claims are justified
- Ensure solution approaches are logically connected to challenges

### Pattern 3: Checking Evaluation Validity

For the **实验** section:
- Verify that experiments actually test the stated claims
- Check that baselines are fair comparisons (same task, same data)
- Ensure metric improvements are attributed to correct causes
- Verify "why baselines perform worse" explanations are logical

### Pattern 4: Checking Abstract-Body Consistency

- Compare abstract claims with actual findings in the body
- Verify "novel", "first", "significant" claims are supported
- Check that methodology in abstract matches methodology section
- Ensure results in abstract match results in evaluation section

## Important Notes

1. **All comments are AI-generated**: Every comment inserted by this skill is generated by AI analysis and must be clearly marked with "AI Comments:". These are NOT human reviewer feedback and should not be treated as such.
2. **Be thorough but fair**: Not every weak argument is a logical fallacy; distinguish between "could be stronger" and "is logically flawed"
3. **Consider context**: Some disciplines have different standards for evidence and argumentation
4. **Preserve author voice**: Comment on logic, not on writing style
5. **Provide actionable feedback**: Always suggest how to fix the issue
6. **Prioritize by severity**: Focus on critical and major issues first
7. **Check cross-references**: Many logical issues appear when comparing different sections
8. **Verify citations**: When claims depend on citations, verify the citation actually supports the claim
9. **Authors should review all AI suggestions**: AI-generated comments are suggestions for consideration, not definitive judgments. Authors should evaluate each suggestion critically.
