# Markdown Review Skill

This skill provides comprehensive review of markdown content for computer science research papers by running all available checkers sequentially. It follows the VibePaper structure rules.

## When to Use This Skill

- User requests to review paper.md (e.g., "review paper.md", "check my paper")
- User wants comprehensive academic quality check
- User wants to run all checkers at once

## Input Files

| File | Required | When to Read | Purpose |
|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `paper.md` | **Required** | Step 1 (start) | Primary analysis target; read to understand paper content for all 7 checkers |
| `.agents/state.json` | Write target | After each checker completes | Persist checker results via CheckerTracker; this skill writes but does not read checker state for content |

Additional files (such as `writingrules.md`, `relatedwork/papers/*.md`, `.agents/cross_index.json`) are read indirectly by the individual checker sub-skills, not by `markdown-review` itself. This orchestrator only reads `paper.md` directly and writes checker results to `.agents/state.json`.

## Review Workflow

This skill runs **seven specialized checkers** in sequence, each focusing on a different aspect of paper quality:

### Checker Execution Order

| Step | Checker | Purpose | Focus Area |
|------|---------|---------|------------|
| 1 | **problem-checker** | Is the problem clearly defined? | Problem validity and motivation |
| 2 | **novelty-checker** | Is the insight novel? | Core contribution validity |
| 3 | **technical-depth-checker** | Is the design deep enough? | Technical contribution quality |
| 4 | **logic-checker** | Are arguments consistent? | Logical coherence |
| 5 | **clarity-checker** | Are terms clear? | Readability and comprehension |
| 6 | **evaluation-protocol-checker** | Is evaluation rigorous? | Experimental validity |
| 7 | **data-checker** | Is data real and reproducible? | Data authenticity |

### Why This Order?

1. **Problem definition first**: If the problem isn't clearly defined and justified, other issues may be moot
2. **Novelty second**: Validates the core insight's novelty after problem is established
3. **Technical depth third**: Validates the method's contribution value
4. **Logic fourth**: Ensures argumentation is sound before diving into details
5. **Clarity fifth**: Improves readability after structural issues are identified
6. **Evaluation protocol sixth**: Checks experimental design rigor
7. **Data last**: Verifies all reported results are real and reproducible

## How This Skill Works

### Step 1: Read Paper Context

First, read the essential files:
1. Read `paper.md` to understand the paper content
2. Do NOT read additional context files directly here. Related-work context, cross-index context, and structure rules are handled indirectly by the individual checker sub-skills.

### Step 2: Run Problem Checker

**Action**: Invoke the problem-checker skill

**What it checks**:
- Is the problem clearly defined?
- Is importance thoroughly supported with evidence?
- Is practical relevance demonstrated?
- Is problem-solution alignment maintained?

**Output**: Problem definition issues with severity levels (Critical/Major/Minor)

### Step 3: Run Novelty Checker

**Action**: Invoke the novelty-checker skill

**What it checks**:
- Is the core insight novel?
- Is there prior work that challenges novelty claims?
- Are novelty claims properly justified?
- Is differentiation from prior work clear?

**Output**: Novelty issues with severity levels (Critical/Major/Minor)

### Step 4: Run Technical Depth Checker

**Action**: Invoke the technical-depth-checker skill

**What it checks**:
- Is the design technically sophisticated?
- Are challenges real and non-trivial?
- Is there sufficient technical detail?
- Are design decisions justified?

**Output**: Technical depth issues with severity levels

### Step 5: Run Logic Checker

**Action**: Invoke the logic-checker skill

**What it checks**:
- Are claims supported by evidence?
- Are there internal contradictions?
- Are there logical fallacies?
- Is abstract-body consistency maintained?

**Output**: Logic issues with severity levels

### Step 6: Run Clarity Checker

**Action**: Invoke the clarity-checker skill

**What it checks**:
- Are all technical terms defined?
- Are acronyms properly expanded?
- Are references and pronouns clear?
- Is terminology used consistently?

**Output**: Clarity issues with severity levels

### Step 7: Run Evaluation Protocol Checker

**Action**: Invoke the evaluation-protocol-checker skill

**What it checks**:
- Do RQs validate the insight?
- Are threats to validity addressed?
- Are baselines comprehensive and fair?
- Are metrics appropriate?

**Output**: Evaluation protocol issues with severity levels

### Step 8: Run Data Checker

**Action**: Invoke the data-checker skill

**What it checks**:
- Is there placeholder/bogus data?
- Do all tables/figures have reproduction scripts?
- Do script outputs match reported results?
- Is data consistent across the paper?

**Output**: Data authenticity issues with severity levels

### Step 9: Generate Comprehensive Report

After all checkers complete, generate a summary report aggregating all findings.

### Inline Comments

Each checker will insert its own formatted HTML comments at relevant locations in `paper.md`. All comments are clearly marked as AI-generated and include:
- Checker name
- Issue type
- Location
- Problem description
- Suggested fix
- Severity level

## Paper Structure Reference

The paper follows VibePaper structure. Key rules for this skill:
- **Level 1** (`#`): Paper title only.
- **Level 2-5** (`##` to `#####`): Structural headings only — do NOT modify these.
- **Level 6** (`######`): Content paragraphs. Title = topic sentence (≤50 chars). Body = supporting text (≤500 chars).

Do NOT read `writingrules.md` — the essential structure rules are inlined above.

## Important Notes

1. **Sequential execution**: Checkers run one after another, each building on previous findings
2. **Comprehensive coverage**: All aspects of paper quality are checked
3. **Severity-based prioritization**: Critical issues are highlighted for immediate attention
4. **AI-generated comments**: All comments are AI analysis, clearly marked to distinguish from human reviewer feedback
5. **Reproducible review**: Run this skill multiple times as you fix issues to track progress
6. **Author responsibility**: Authors should review all AI suggestions critically before implementing

### Example 1: Full Review

```
User: review my paper
Assistant: I'll run a comprehensive review of your paper using all seven checkers.
[Runs problem-checker → novelty-checker → technical-depth-checker → logic-checker → clarity-checker → evaluation-protocol-checker → data-checker]
