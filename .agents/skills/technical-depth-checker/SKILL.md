# Technical Depth Checker Skill

This skill evaluates the technical depth of a paper's design section, ensuring it contains significant new designs, addresses real challenges that cannot be solved with simple solutions, and provides sufficient technical detail for the claimed contribution.

## When to Use This Skill

- User requests to check technical depth (e.g., "check technical depth", "is the design deep enough?")
- User wants to verify design significance and complexity
- User needs to ensure challenges are non-trivial
- User wants to strengthen technical contributions

## Role and Responsibilities

You are an AI assistant performing technical depth analysis of academic papers. Your comments are AI-generated and must be clearly marked as such. Your analysis should be:
- **Expert-level**: Assess against state-of-the-art technical standards
- **Critical**: Honestly evaluate whether challenges are real and solutions are non-trivial
- **Constructive**: Suggest how to increase technical depth
- **Domain-aware**: Consider domain-specific expectations for depth
- **Transparent**: All comments must be explicitly marked as AI-generated

## Technical Depth Issue Types

### 1. Shallow or Trivial Design

**Definition**: The design lacks significant new contributions and appears too simple for a research paper.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Direct Application** | Simply applies existing technique without adaptation | "We use BERT for text classification" without novel adaptation |
| **Configuration Change** | Only differs in parameters/settings | "We set learning rate to 0.001 instead of 0.01" |
| **Pipeline Assembly** | Just combines existing tools | "We use Spark + Kafka + Flink" as-is |
| **Obvious Extension** | Straightforward extension anyone would do | Add one feature that naturally follows from prior work |
| **Implementation Only** | Novelty claimed for implementation details | "We implemented X in Rust" when algorithm is unchanged |

### 2. Missing Technical Challenges

**Definition**: The design doesn't address real challenges or the challenges are not actually difficult.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **No Challenge Stated** | Design presented without discussing challenges | Method described but no difficulties mentioned |
| **Pseudo-Challenges** | Claimed challenges are trivial or already solved | "Challenge: We need to store data" (solved by databases) |
| **Missing Why-Hard Analysis** | Doesn't explain why problem is hard | States "this is challenging" without explanation |
| **Challenge Not Addressed** | Challenge mentioned but design doesn't solve it | Lists challenge, solution ignores it |
| **Over-Simplified Challenge** | Real challenge exists but oversimplified | Complex problem reduced to trivial solution |

### 3. Obvious or Standard Solutions

**Definition**: The proposed solution could be achieved with simple, standard, or obvious approaches.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Standard Library Solution** | Could use existing library/framework | Custom implementation when standard library exists |
| **Textbook Approach** | Uses well-known technique as if novel | Standard algorithm presented as innovation |
| **Off-the-Shelf Components** | Just configures existing components | "We configured K8s with 3 replicas" |
| **Brute Force Solution** | Solution is simple enumeration/search | "We check all possibilities" without optimization |
| **Obvious Heuristic** | Intuitive heuristic anyone would think of | "We use most frequent item" as sophisticated method |

### 4. Insufficient Technical Detail

**Definition**: The design lacks the technical detail necessary for readers to understand or reproduce the contribution.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Missing Algorithm Details** | Algorithm described at too high level | "We use ML to classify" without model/architecture |
| **Missing Implementation Details** | No implementation specifics | No data structures, APIs, or component details |
| **Missing Parameters** | Key parameters not specified | "We tuned parameters" without values |
| **Missing Data Structures** | No discussion of data structures | Claims efficiency without data structure design |
| **Missing Workflow** | No clear execution flow | Components described but no interaction diagram |
| **Missing Edge Cases** | Only happy path described | No discussion of failure cases or exceptions |

### 5. Missing Design Rationale

**Definition**: Design decisions are not justified with technical reasoning.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Arbitrary Choices** | Design choices made without justification | "We chose X" without explaining why |
| **Missing Trade-off Analysis** | No discussion of alternatives | Doesn't explain why X over Y |
| **No Comparative Reasoning** | Doesn't compare with alternatives | "Our approach is better" without comparison |
| **Missing Constraint Analysis** | Constraints not discussed | Doesn't explain constraints that motivated design |
| **No Design Principles** | Underlying principles not articulated | Complex design without guiding principles |

### 6. Missing Complexity Analysis

**Definition**: No analysis of time/space complexity or why the approach handles complexity well.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **No Complexity Claim** | Claims efficiency without complexity analysis | "Our method is efficient" without Big-O |
| **No Scalability Discussion** | Doesn't discuss how it scales | No mention of performance under load |
| **Missing Bottleneck Analysis** | Doesn't identify computational bottlenecks | No discussion of what's expensive |
| **No Resource Analysis** | Resource requirements not discussed | Memory/CPU/Network requirements absent |
| **Unrealistic Complexity Claims** | Claims not backed by analysis | "O(1) lookup" without data structure justification |

### 7. Superficial Challenge-Solution Mapping

**Definition**: The mapping between challenges and solutions is weak or superficial.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Generic Solution** | One-size-fits-all solution for specific challenge | Generic approach for domain-specific problem |
| **Challenge Mismatch** | Solution doesn't actually address stated challenge | Challenge: "scalability" → Solution: "better UI" |
| **Missing Challenge-Solution Link** | No explicit connection between challenge and design | Challenges listed, solutions not linked |
| **Shallow Mapping** | Link exists but superficial | "Challenge X → we use technique Y" without depth |

### 8. Missing Alternative Design Discussion

**Definition**: No discussion of alternative designs and why they were not chosen.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **No Alternatives Considered** | Only one design presented | Doesn't mention other possible approaches |
| **Strawman Alternatives** | Alternatives are obviously bad | Compares only to trivial baselines |
| **Missing Design Space** | Design space not explored | Doesn't discuss spectrum of possible designs |
| **No Ablation Justification** | No explanation for why components are needed | Components added without necessity argument |

### 9. Insufficient Novelty in Design

**Definition**: The design doesn't introduce sufficient novel components or techniques.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **All Components Standard** | No novel component in the design | Everything is off-the-shelf |
| **No Novel Technique** | No new algorithm/method introduced | Uses only existing techniques |
| **No Novel Combination** | Combination also not novel | Combination of A+B also exists in prior work |
| **Minor Variation Only** | Only minor tweaks to existing designs | Tiny modification of prior approach |

### 10. Missing Domain-Specific Depth

**Definition**: Lacks the depth expected in the specific domain (systems, ML, theory, etc.).

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Systems Paper: No Architecture** | Systems paper without architectural depth | No component diagram, no distributed design |

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Checking Algorithm Papers

For algorithm-focused papers, check:
- Is there formal pseudocode?
- Is there complexity analysis (time/space)?
- Is there correctness proof or argument?
- Are there optimizations discussed?
- Is there comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms?
- Are edge cases handled?

### Pattern 2: Checking Systems Papers

For systems-focused papers, check:
- Is there architecture diagram?
- Are component interactions described?
- Is there scalability analysis?
- Are distributed aspects discussed (if applicable)?
- Is there performance optimization?
- Are failure modes and recovery discussed?
- Is there resource usage analysis?

### Pattern 3: Checking ML Papers

For ML-focused papers, check:
- Is model architecture specified?
- Are hyperparameters and training details provided?
- Is there discussion of why this architecture?
- Are training challenges discussed?
- Is there ablation study?
- Are baselines comprehensive and fair?

### Pattern 4: Evaluating Challenge Difficulty

When evaluating claimed challenges:
- Is the challenge real? (exists in practice)
- Is the challenge hard? (not trivially solvable)
- Is there evidence of difficulty? (prior attempts failed)
- Why do simple approaches fail? (explicit analysis)
- Is the challenge domain-appropriate? (relevant to problem)

### Pattern 5: Assessing Design Sophistication

To assess sophistication:
- Are non-obvious design decisions made?
- Are there clever optimizations?
- Is there deep understanding of trade-offs?
- Are domain-specific constraints handled well?
- Are edge cases considered?
- Is there engineering craftsmanship?

## Important Notes

1. **All comments are AI-generated**: Every comment inserted by this skill is generated by AI analysis and must be clearly marked with "AI Comments:". These are NOT human reviewer feedback and should not be treated as such.

2. **Depth varies by contribution type**: Algorithms need formal analysis, systems need architectural depth, ML needs model detail, empirical needs methodological rigor.

3. **Consider target venue**: Top-tier venues (NSDI, OSDI, SOSP, SIGCOMM) expect high technical depth. Workshops may have lower bars.

4. **Balance depth and clarity**: Deep technical content should still be clearly explained. Depth without clarity is not helpful.

5. **Depth is necessary but not sufficient**: Technical depth is required but doesn't guarantee acceptance. Also need novelty, evaluation, etc.

6. **Real challenges matter**: Pseudo-challenges are easy to spot and weaken credibility. Focus on real, hard challenges.

7. **Engineering sophistication counts**: For systems papers, engineering depth (clever optimizations, handling edge cases) is valuable.

8. **Compare to similar work**: What do similar papers include? This is a good baseline for expectations.

9. **Authors should verify**: AI may miss domain-specific depth conventions. Authors should ensure their domain's expectations are met.

10. **Provide constructive paths**: Even if depth is lacking, show how to increase it.
