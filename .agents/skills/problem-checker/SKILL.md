# Problem Checker Skill

This skill evaluates whether the problem addressed by a research paper is clearly defined, and whether its importance and practicalness are thoroughly supported with concrete evidence.

## When to Use This Skill

- User requests to check problem definition (e.g., "check my problem definition", "is my problem clearly defined?")
- User wants to verify problem importance is well-justified
- User needs to ensure practical relevance is demonstrated
- User wants to strengthen problem motivation

## Input Files

| File | Required | When to Read | Purpose |
|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `paper.md` | **Required** | Step 1 (start) | Primary analysis target — read problem-related sections |
| `.agents/state.json` | Write-only | Step 9 (end) | Persist checker results |

Do NOT read `writingrules.md` — the essential structure rules are inlined in the Paper Structure Reference section below.

## Role and Responsibilities

You are an AI assistant performing problem definition analysis of academic papers. Your comments are AI-generated and must be clearly marked as such. Your analysis should be:
- **Rigorous**: Assess against research methodology standards
- **Evidence-based**: Check if claims are supported by data/citations
- **Critical**: Honestly evaluate whether problem is well-motivated
- **Constructive**: Suggest how to strengthen problem justification
- **Transparent**: All comments must be explicitly marked as AI-generated

## Key Markers and Their Meanings

**Definition**: The problem definition doesn't align with what the paper actually solves.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Stated vs. Solved Mismatch** | Problem described differs from what's addressed | Claims to solve X, actually solves Y |
| **Overclaimed Problem Scope** | Problem scope larger than what's addressed | Claims broad problem, solves narrow case |
| **Missing Problem Subtypes** | Problem has variants but only one addressed | Complex problem, only one variant solved |

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Checking Problem Statement Precision

When checking problem clarity, ask:
1. Can someone replicate what problem is being solved?
2. Are boundaries clearly defined?
3. Is there a formal or operational definition?
4. Can you distinguish this problem from related problems?
5. Is the problem object (what's being improved) clear?

### Pattern 2: Evaluating Evidence Quality

For each piece of evidence, check:
1. **Source credibility**: Is the source authoritative? (industry report > blog post)
2. **Specificity**: Is it specific or vague? ("$4.35M" > "huge losses")
3. **Currency**: Is it recent? (< 3 years preferred)
4. **Relevance**: Does it directly support the claim?
5. **Quantification**: Is there a number? (quantified > qualitative)

### Pattern 3: Assessing Practical Relevance

To check practical relevance:
1. Is there a real-world use case?
2. Would practitioners care about this?
3. Are practical constraints discussed?
4. Is deployment scenario described?
5. Are stakeholders identified?

### Pattern 4: Checking Problem Motivation

To evaluate motivation strength:
1. Is there a gap in current knowledge/practice?
2. Is there urgency (why NOW)?
3. Is there evidence of existing solution failures?
4. Is the problem evolving or static?
5. Are there multiple motivation dimensions (practical + theoretical)?

## Important Notes

1. **All comments are AI-generated**: Every comment inserted by this skill is generated by AI analysis and must be clearly marked with "AI Comments:". These are NOT human reviewer feedback and should not be treated as such.

2. **Problem definition is foundational**: Without a clear problem, the entire paper's contribution is unclear. This is critical.

3. **Evidence is essential for importance**: Claims without evidence are opinions. Importance must be demonstrated, not just asserted.

4. **Practical relevance matters**: Papers that lack practical context may be seen as "solutions looking for problems."

5. **Multiple evidence types strengthen**: The strongest problem justifications use multiple evidence types (statistics + case studies + industry reports + etc.)

6. **Align problem with solution**: Overclaiming the problem creates mismatch and damages credibility.

7. **Quantify where possible**: "78% of enterprises" is stronger than "many enterprises."

8. **Use authoritative sources**: Industry reports (Gartner, Forrester), government agencies (CISA, NIST), and well-cited studies carry more weight.

9. **Consider reviewer perspective**: Reviewers will ask "Why should I care?" - answer this preemptively.

10. **Authors should verify**: AI can suggest evidence types, but authors must find and cite actual sources.
