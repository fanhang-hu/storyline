# Data Checker Skill

This skill validates evaluation data authenticity by detecting bogus/placeholder data and ensuring every table and figure has a linked reproduction script that generates matching results.

## When to Use This Skill

- User requests to check data authenticity (e.g., "check for bogus data", "verify data reproducibility")
- User wants to ensure all results are reproducible
- User needs to verify scripts match reported results
- User wants to prepare for paper submission

## Input Files

| File | Required | When to Read | Purpose |
|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `paper.md` | **Required** | Step 1 (start) | Primary analysis target — scan for bogus markers, tables, figures |
| `scripts/` | Conditional | Step 4-6 | Verify reproduction scripts exist and run correctly |
| Data files | Conditional | Step 6 | Verify script dependencies exist |
| `.agents/state.json` | Write-only | Final step | Persist checker results |

Do NOT read `writingrules.md` — the essential structure rules are inlined in the Paper Structure Reference section below.

## Role and Responsibilities

You are an AI assistant performing data authenticity and reproducibility analysis. Your comments are AI-generated and must be clearly marked as such. Your analysis should be:
- **Thorough**: Check all tables, figures, and numbers
- **Strict**: Any placeholder data is a critical issue
- **Reproducible**: Verify every result has a reproduction script
- **Executable**: Actually run scripts and compare outputs
- **Transparent**: All comments must be explicitly marked as AI-generated

## Key Markers and Their Meanings

| Marker | Meaning | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `<!-- AI Comments:` | Start of AI-generated comment | ALWAYS use to begin every comment |
| `**AI-GENERATED DATA CHECK ANALYSIS - FOR AUTHOR REVIEW**` | Warning that content is AI-generated | ALWAYS include at the start of comment body |
| `[DATA ISSUE TYPE]` | Category of data problem | ALWAYS include to classify the issue |
| `[LOCATION]` | Where the issue is found | ALWAYS include with section name and exact quote |
| `[SEVERITY]` | How serious the issue is | ALWAYS include (Critical/Major/Minor) |
| `**END AI-GENERATED DATA CHECK ANALYSIS**` | End of AI analysis content | ALWAYS include before closing `-->` |

## Data Issue Types

### 1. Bogus/Placeholder Data Detected

**Definition**: Placeholder data markers found that indicate synthetic/unreal data.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Scan for Bogus Data Markers

Search `paper.md` for:
1. ⚠️ BOGUS markers
2. "REPLACE WITH" instructions
3. Placeholder patterns (X%, Y times, Z ms)
4. ⚠️ TABLE/FIGURE warnings
5. BOGUS STATISTICS markers

### Step 2: Identify All Tables and Figures

From `paper.md`:
1. Find all markdown tables
2. Find all figure references
3. Find all numerical results in text
4. Note location of each data element

### Step 3: Check Reproduction Script Links

For each table/figure:
1. Is there a link to a reproduction script?
2. Is the link in proper format?
3. Is the script path clear?

**Expected format for script links**:
```markdown
**Table 1: Performance Comparison**
[Reproduction script: `scripts/table1_performance.py`]
```

or

```markdown
**Figure 1: Detection Rate Comparison**
[Generated by: `scripts/fig1_detection_rate.py`]
```

### Step 4: Verify Scripts Exist

For each linked script:
1. Check if file exists at specified path
2. Check if scripts/ directory exists
3. Check if repository has reproducibility artifacts

### Step 5: Check Script Information

For each script:
1. Is there a README or documentation?
2. Are dependencies specified?
3. Are parameters documented?
4. Is data source specified?
5. Are random seeds specified (for stochastic scripts)?

### Step 6: Execute Scripts

For each script:
1. Create isolated environment if needed
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the script
4. Capture output
5. Compare with reported results

**Comparison criteria**:
- Numbers must match within tolerance (0.01% for percentages)
- Table structure must match
- All reported values must be present

### Step 7: Compare Outputs

For each table/figure:
1. Parse script output
2. Parse reported table/figure data
3. Compare values
4. Flag mismatches

### Step 8: Check Data Consistency

Cross-reference:
1. Same metric in different locations
2. Sums and totals
3. Cross-table consistency
4. Text-to-table consistency

### Step 9: Generate Comments

For each issue found:
1. Classify the type (from 8 categories)
2. Quote the exact location
3. Explain the data concern
4. Describe impact
5. Provide required actions
6. List verification steps
7. Assign severity level

### Step 10: Provide Summary Report

Generate comprehensive data authenticity assessment.

## Paper Structure Reference

The paper follows VibePaper structure. Key rules for this checker:
- **Level 1-5** (`#` to `#####`): Structural headings only — no body text allowed under these.
- **Level 6** (`######`): Content paragraphs. Title = topic sentence (≤50 chars). Body = supporting text (≤500 chars).
- **Metadata**: HTML comments `<!-- description: ... -->` guide what each section should contain.

### Key Sections to Check

1. **实验方案 Section**: What datasets are described? What metrics are defined? What baselines are compared?
2. **实验结果 Section**: What tables and figures contain data? Are there bogus markers? Are script links present?
3. **Tables and Figures**: Do all tables have reproduction script links? Do figures have generation scripts?
4. **Scripts and Data**: Do reproduction scripts exist? Do they run correctly? Do outputs match reported results?

## Reproduction Script Standards

### Required Script Elements

Every reproduction script should include:

**1. Header Documentation**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Table 1: Performance Comparison
Generates the performance comparison table for Section X.Y

Usage:
    python scripts/table1_performance.py

Requirements:
    - Python 3.8+
    - pandas, numpy, matplotlib
    - Data: data/apt_dataset.csv

Output:
    - Prints markdown table to stdout
    - Saves results to results/table1.csv

Random seed: 42 (for reproducibility)
"""
```

**2. Dependencies**
- requirements.txt or environment.yml
- Clear version specifications

**3. Data Sources**
- Clear documentation of data files needed
- Data files should be in repository or download instructions provided

**4. Parameters**
- All parameters as constants at top of script
- Or loaded from config file

**5. Random Seeds**
- Explicit random seed setting for reproducibility
- Document seed value

**6. Output Format**

- [ ] requirements.txt for dependencies
- [ ] data/ directory with datasets
- [ ] results/ directory for script outputs
- [ ] README.md with reproducibility instructions
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Checking for Bogus Data Markers

Search for all instances of:
- `⚠️ [BOGUS`
- `⚠️ TABLE CONTAINS BOGUS`
- `⚠️ FIGURE PLACEHOLDER`
- `REPLACE WITH`
- `⚠️ [BOGUS STATISTICS`
- Placeholder patterns: `X%`, `Y times`, `Z ms` (when used as variables)

### Pattern 2: Verifying Script Links

For each table/figure, check:
1. Is there a script link in any of these formats:
   - `[Reproduction script: path/to/script.py]`
   - `[Generated by: path/to/script.py]`
   - `Script: path/to/script.py`
   - Link in table caption
   
2. Is the path specific and correct?

### Pattern 3: Running Scripts Safely

When running reproduction scripts:
1. Use isolated environment
2. Check dependencies first
3. Set timeout for long-running scripts
4. Capture stdout and stderr
5. Handle errors gracefully

### Pattern 4: Comparing Results

When comparing script output to reported data:
1. Parse both into structured format
2. Compare each numeric value
3. Allow tolerance: 0.01 for percentages
4. Check structure matches (rows, columns)
5. Report specific mismatches

## Important Notes

1. **All comments are AI-generated**: Every comment inserted by this skill is generated by AI analysis and must be clearly marked with "AI Comments:". These are NOT human reviewer feedback and should not be treated as such.

2. **Zero tolerance for bogus data**: Any placeholder data is a critical issue that blocks submission.

3. **Reproducibility is essential**: Modern venues require reproducibility. Missing scripts are major issues.

4. **Scripts must match exactly**: Script output should match paper data precisely (within tolerance).

5. **Test in clean environment**: Scripts should work in a fresh environment, not just author's machine.

6. **Document everything**: Scripts need documentation, dependencies, parameters.

7. **Random seeds matter**: For stochastic methods, seeds must be specified and used.

8. **Data files needed**: If scripts need data files, those must be provided too.

9. **Consistency is critical**: Same metric should have same value everywhere (unless different experiments).

10. **Authors must verify**: AI can detect issues but authors must fix and verify.
